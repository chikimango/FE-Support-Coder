# FEFSC
Fire Emblem Fates: Support Coder

A JavaFX program that assists in coding supports for Fire Emblem 3ds games

# How to Compile

> 1. Download IntelliJ Idea
> 2. Create a new JavaFX project called FESC
> 3. Extract the master into the project file and overwrite all files
> 4. Go to *Build -> Build Artifacts* and build FESC as a JavaFX output

# How to Use
The program is relatively straightforward if you already have previous knowledge on how to code supports, but I'll be explaining how FESC works below. For reference, [here's](http://pastebin.com/0g7jf3i3) a guide on coding supports.


### Character Options:

Fairly straightforward: This is where you choose the names of the two characters who **appear first** in the support. Character 1 will appear on the left of the screen and character 2 will appear on the right. How to handle adding, removing, or replacing characters from the support will be explained in the Effects Options.


### Dialogue Input:

Again fairly straightforward: Just write in (or copy and paste) the first line of dialogue from your support. 
**Make sure you do not exceed the box's proportions.** It will allow you to exceed two lines, but only two lines fit in the actual dialogue box from the game. The proportions of the box are the same as the proportions of the game's.

What "Don't forget to add "\n" if the text wraps" means is thart if your dialogue is over one row, then you need to type in "\n" at the beginning of the second row like so:

This is to indicate a newline and is best done after you've finished typing all of your dialogue. If your dialogue goes over the box's proportions after adding the "\n" don't worry, the "\n" will dissapear in-game and in FEITS. What matters is if your dialogue alone goes over the proportions. 

If you don't add the "\n" this is how it'll look in FEITS and in-game:

### First Line Button & Song Options
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/MhsfyVI.png)

There isn't much to explain here, but it is important. **The "first line" button should only be selected if you are on the first line of your support. You only select it once when creating your entire support.** This button will add code to make the game initiallize the characters on the screen and what music is playing. **Again, it is very important that you press this at the beginning of your support or else the support will not work correctly in-game OR in FEITS.**

I think the song choices is pretty self-explanatory, you just choose which song you want to play in your support in-game. You can choose none if you'd like, and there are play/pause buttons on the right to sample the songs. This combo-box will only be enabled when the first line button is selected, because the song is initiallized at the beginning of the support.


### Character Speaking Buttons & The "Appears Alone" Button
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/obgejEW.png)

This is fairly simple, but can be confusing if you're coding supports for the first time. 
For the 1st/2nd Character Buttons: You select these depending on who is saying the dialogue you already wrote in the dialogue input box. HOWEVER: If you have dialogue that is continuing from the previous input, then select the "Same as Previous Character" button.

If you look at a video of a support from FE:F or FE:A you see that a character usually doesn't stop talking after one box of dialogue. So basically, you want to select the 1st/2nd buttons at the start of when a character is speaking or when the speaker changes. If the character keeps speaking after that, you select the "Same as Previous Character" button.

For the Appears Alone Button: This button will only be selectable when you've selected the First Line Button or when you've chosen the "Fade to Black" effect option that is explained later. You only press this button if the speaking character appears alone whenever the characters have to be initailized, which is only at the beginning of the support or after a fade to black scene. **You'll need to initallize the other character in Effects Options _when they first appear_ by selecting "Character 1/2 Appears".** More information about those options and what they do/can do is further down.


### Displayed Emotion & Portrait Viewer
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/SerRt6h.png)

Not much to explain, here you choose what face the character is making. If the character is blushing or sweating you just select the blushing/sweat buttons. You can select both if you want to.

You can view the portraits of the character if you've selected the 1st character or 2nd character buttons by clicking "View Portrait". That will open up this window:

Which as you can see, displays either the 1st or 2nd character you've chosen in the character options and the emotion you've selected for them. **If you have "Same as Previous Character" selected no portrait will show**, so just select the 1st/2nd button and reselect "Same as Previous Character" when you're done. **Don't forget to reselect it!**
Note: The "Same as Previous Emotion" option works the same way as the "Same as Previous Character" button does.


### Effects Options & Sound Effects
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/GAP3foc.png)

This is where things get lengthy and possibly confusing. There are quite a few options and combinations to cover that are very important, so I'll be explaining each option in Effects. 

But first, sound effects, as that is much faster to explain. Basically there's an option in Effects for adding sound effects. When you select that option the Sound Effects options will be enabled. Just choose which one you'd like. There's no way to play the options so here's a description for each:
> "Body Fall" is the sound effect that plays when, well, a body falls. An example for that is in Kaze and Silas's C support.

> "Damage" plays when a character recieves damage. There's an example of it in Kaze and Silas's C support as well.

> "Dish Break" - I think it's pretty obvious what this is. If you need an example, this sound plays in almost every Felicia support.

Alright, so Effects. First, here are all the options for the first box.
> Default Line: Does nothing.

> Screen Fades to Black

> Character 1 Appears: This is really only used if character 2 is alone.

> Character 2 Appears: Same as above except with character 1.

> Character 1 Left: Note the past tense. This makes character 1 dissapear from view.

> Character 2 Left: Same as above for character 2.

> Add Sound Effect

The second box has three options.
> No other Effect: Does nothing

> New Character Appears

> Add Sound Effect

Here's what you need to know for every option:
First of all: **All of these options will happen _before_ your current dialogue appears. It is important to keep note of this for every option, because if you select an effect at the wrong time it could completely mess up the sequence of events for your support.** 
To elaborate, remember when I said to keep note the past tense in "Character 1 Left"? Well, Let's say you want character 1 to leave after they say "Goodbye". After they leave you want character 2 to say "Wait". You should not choose the effect option when you're on the line "Goodbye", you want to select it when character 2 says "Wait", because the effect will happen before character 2 says anything. That's why it's in past tense.
For the option "Character 1/2 appears", it's a bit different. Because the character is being initialized, you'll want to select it when said character first says something. For example: Character 1 is alone and they say "Hello" then character 2 appears and says "Hello" as well. Again, because the effect happens before the character speaks, you're going to want to select the effect option when character 2 says "Hello." because if you select it when character 1 speaks, character 2 will appear prematurely.

Remember: If you chose "Character 1/2 Left" and want them to reappear later, you have to choose "Character 1/2 Appears".

On "Screen Fades to Black": This will reinitialize all the characters, so if you want to add a new character or switch characters **do it when you select this option.** Remember, the screen will fade to black BEFORE the dialogue appears. Don't select it too early.

For adding/switching characters anytime: When you want to switch in a new character you need to first choose the option "Character 1/2 Left" in the first option box, and then choose "New Character Appears" in the second box. This will make a third character box appear. Choose the new character there, they will switch places accordingly. If you ever want the old character to reappear, just do the same exact thing except choose the old character in the third character box. 
If you want to add a character after one has already left, just replace the name of the character who left with the new character in the character 1/2 boxes, and then select "Character 1/2 Appears". Once again, remember this happens before the dialogue appears.

And that's it for effects. It might sound a bit daunting, but it's very easy to get into the rythm of it. It's all just trial and error!

### "Add Line" Button & Support Output
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/QoeWozt.png)

When you're finished choosing the options for the dialogue you've inputted, click the "Add Line" button, and the program will take your dialogue and code it appropriately. The coded dialogue will be placed into the the area below the button. 
Once you've finished adding all of your lines of dialogue, just copy the finished support and put it into FEITS to see it. 
Be aware though: Even if the support works in FEITS it may not work correctly in the actual game.
